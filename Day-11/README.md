## üèóÔ∏è File Organization Benefits

This enterprise-grade structure provides:

### **Separation of Concerns**
- Each file has a specific purpose and resource type
- Easy to locate and modify specific components
- Reduces complexity and improves maintainability

### **Team Collaboration**
- Multiple developers can work on different files simultaneously
- Clear ownership and responsibility for different infrastructure components
- Easier code reviews and conflict resolution

### **Scalability**
- Easy to add new resource types in appropriate files
- Modular structure supports growth and complexity
- Can be easily converted to Terraform modules

### **Best Practices**
- Follows industry standards used by enterprise teams
- Prepares students for real-world DevOps environments
- Demonstrates professional Terraform project structure

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

1. **AWS Account** with appropriate permissions
2. **Terraform installed** (version >= 1.0)
3. **AWS CLI configured** with your credentials
4. **SSH key pair** (optional, for EC2 access)

### Installation Commands

```bash
# Install Terraform (Linux/Mac)
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.6.0/terraform_1.6.0_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.6.0_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
terraform --version

# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone and Navigate
```bash
git clone https://github.com/toktechteam/15-Days-DevOps-Job-Journey.git
cd 15-Days-DevOps-Job-Journey/Day-11/tf-code
```

### Step 2: Understand the File Structure
Take time to examine each file and understand its purpose:

```bash
# View the file organization
ls -la

# Examine each file's purpose
cat versions.tf     # Version constraints
cat providers.tf    # Provider configurations
cat variables.tf    # Variable definitions
cat data.tf         # Data sources
# ... and so on
```

### Step 3: Customize Variables
Edit `terraform.tfvars` file:
```hcl
aws_region = "us-east-1"           # Your preferred region
environment = "dev"                # Environment name
owner_email = "your@email.com"     # Your email
instance_type = "t3.micro"         # Instance size
allowed_ssh_cidr = "YOUR_IP/32"    # Your IP for SSH
```

### Step 4: Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```
This command:
- Downloads required provider plugins
- Initializes the working directory
- Prepares for terraform operations

### Step 5: Validate the Configuration
```bash
terraform validate
```
This checks for syntax errors and validates the configuration.

### Step 6: Format the Code
```bash
terraform fmt
```
This formats your code according to Terraform style guidelines.

### Step 7: Plan the Deployment
```bash
terraform plan
```
This command:
- Shows what resources will be created
- Validates your configuration
- Estimates costs (if configured)

### Step 8: Apply the Configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```
This command:
- Creates the planned resources
- Updates the state file
- Shows outputs when complete

### Step 9: Verify Deployment
After successful apply, you'll see comprehensive outputs including:
```
instance_public_ip = "54.123.45.67"
application_url = "http://54.123.45.67"
ssh_connection_command = "ssh -i demo-keypair.pem ec2-user@54.123.45.67"
s3_bucket_name = "dev-devops-demo-bucket-a1b2c3d4"
```
